      <h1>Hello there, I am <b>Pedro Ferreira</b>.</h1>
      <p>I am brazilian Business Major in Business Administration from Rio de Janeiro's Federal University (UFRJ), currently living in Brasil and studying Softwater Development at the <i>Bow Valley College,</i> on Calgary-AB, Canada.</p>
      <p>Formaly working as a Project Manager for both the <a href="https://www.telefonica.com/en/">Telefonica Group</a> and <a href="https://verisoft.com.br/">Verisoft</a>, I decided expand my horizons and improve my knowledge by starting my studies
        on <em>Software Development</em> and, in the near future, plan to move to Canada.</p>
      <p>I was born in 1989 and have lived most of my life in Rio de Janeiro. While most of the people around look at me as an extrovert with a lot to talk about, I consider myself more of a absurdly curious introvert with a hunger for learning. Life
        has taught me not to be shy about my wishes, look for opportunities at every crevice and to stand my ground at every inch.</p>

    <div class="currentBody" id="hobbies">
      <h1>Reading Fantasy and Sci-Fi</h1>
      <p>Personally, I love reading and collecting fantasy and sci-fi books, with my personal favorites being <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>Harry Potter</em> franchises, along with authors <em>Arthur C. Clarke</em> and <em>Isaac Asimov</em>.
        If I had to pick a favorite book, it would be either <em>Childhood's End</em> by the first or <em>Foudation</em> by the latter. However, if I had to save one piece of writing (or suggest reading to everyone on the planet) it would be <a
          href="https://www.physics.princeton.edu/ph115/LQ.pdf"><em>The Last Question</em></a>, a short story by Asimov, which is by far the work of fiction that had the most impact in my life.</p>
      <h1>Collecting Lego Bionicle</h1>
      <table style="border-spacing: 5px">
        <tr>
          <td>
            While not a continuous hobby per se, I collected most of the Lego Bionicle series and consider it to be my most prized collection. I started collecting it in 2001 and only stopped when the series came to an end in 2010.
            <br>
            <br>
            My collection started with the set <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=8536-1">8536 - Kopaka</a>, released in 2001 when I was 11, thus it's possible to see the wear and tear of the set on the image beside. The
            Bionicle Saga, compromised of the sets, comics, movies and books were a big part of my life and a great influence to me as a kid and teenager.
            <br>
            <br>
            Today, my collection spams more than 200 sets and is one of my major issues with moving to Canada, since I expect to one day be able to take all of them with me.

      </table>
      <h1>RPG and Gamming</h1>
      <p>Another big part of my life is gamming and most specially table-top (now digital, online Table-Top) RPGs. Role-Playing Games such as Dungeons and Dragons and GURPS were part of my life since I was a kid and helped me develop both as an
        individual by improving my social skills and as a professional by improving several of my organization and time-management skills.</p>
      <p>Not only RPG was a great tool for learning on itself, but it also prompted me to action on learning english so I could consume materials that weren't translated to my native language and developed my taste in reading. </p>
      <p>Table-Top RPGs are usually played using dices with multiple number of sides. For example, a six sided dice is refered to a as d6. Since the Pandemic forced us to start playing online-only, we make use of dice rollers such as this one below to be able to play:</p>

    <div class="currentBody" id="javaScriptCS">

      <h1>JavaScript Cheat Sheet</h1>
      <p>Here follow a simple cheat sheet with some snippets created from lectures and internet research, these codes reflect some of the information I find interesting to remember.</p>

      <h4>Activate a Function on Click</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>While not exactly javascript, it's important to remember that by adding the tag <i>onClick="function()"</i> to a HTML element will allow it to call the given function when clicked. This is especially useful for making interactive divs.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Getting values and information from HTML</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>Allows us to target a specific id value, style or other data from a document by replaxing x with the apropriate value.<br><br>
      <b>variable = document.getElementById("id").value;</b><br>
      <i>Allows us to give the sought value to a variable.</i><br>
      <b>document.getElementById("id").value = variable;</b><br>
      <i>Allows us to push the value of a variable into the element, for instance, a text box.</i><br>
      <b>document.getElementById("id").innerHTML = variable;</b><br>
      <i>Changes what is inside the tag to the variable.</i><br>
      </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Set Timeout</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>Allows us to set a timer in miliseconds so that a function will be called to run when the timer is done. Very useful for recursive functions.<br><br>
      <b>function victoryCheck(){<br>
        setTimeout(function(){victoryCheck()}, 1000);<br>
      }</b><br><br>
      <i>This function, after being called once will run itself every one second, allowing for a miriad of uses in terms of checking some information on a game or page.</i>
      </p>
      </div>

      <h4>String Methods</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>Here are some of the useful string methods to remember.<br><br>
      <b>string.replace("x","y");</b><br>
      <i>Changes whatever instance of "x" inside the string to a "y".</i><br>
      <b>string.includes("something");</b><br>
      <i>Returns true or false if a string includes "something" in it's composition.</i><br>
      <b>string.startWith("something") and string.endWith("something");</b><br>
      <i>Similar to the one above, returns true or false if the string either starts with or ends with "something", depending on the method.</i><br>
      </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Array Methods</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>Javascript allows for several array modification methods, making the life much easier.<br><br>
      <b>array.pop() and array.shift();</b><br>
      <i>Allows us to pop the last element or shift the first element from an array. Either actions pull the element out of the array, either into the void or into a variable.</i><br>
      <b>array.push();</b><br>
      <i>Allows us to insert a new element, whatever is inside the parenthesis, into the end of an array.</i><br>
      <b>array.join(", ");</b><br>
      <i>Joins all elements of an array into a string, adding whatever is inside the quotations as a separator. In this case, each element of the array will be joined in a string separated by ", ".</i><br>
      </p>
      </div>

      <h4>For Of</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>An easier and more intuitive of making iterations for arrays.<br><br>
      <b>for (variable of array) {<br>
      do something...<br>
      }</b><br>
      <i>Will perform whatever statements are inside the for loop, considering each value on the arrays.</i><br>
      </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Alerts and Prompts</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>Ways of communicating and getting input from the user without using a input element on HTML.<br><br>
      <b>alert("Hello World");</b><br>
      <i>Will pop up an alert box with the message "Hello World".</i><br>
      <b>array.push(prompt("Enter a number:"));</b><br>
      <i>Will pop up an box with the message "Enter a Number" and an input text for the user. In this example, it will get whatever input the user enters and push into the end of the array.</i><br>
      </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Parsing Values</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>This function makes sure a value stored in an array is returned as an int or a NaN.<br><br>
      <b>variable = parseInt(array[i]);</b><br>
      <i>Will push on the i index from the array into the variable as a int.</i><br>
      </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Creating Objects</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>How to create objects in Javascript.<br><br>
      <b>let object = {</b><br>
      <b>name: "Pedro",</b><br>
      <b>lastname: "Ferreira",</b><br>
      <b>Age: 20</b><br>
      <b>}</b><br>
      <i>With the object done, using each of the keys allows access to the information, for instance: object.name would return the string "Pedro". Objects can be arrays and can contain arrays or nested functions inside.</i></i><br>
      </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Fetching JSONs</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>The methods fetch() and json() allows us to seek a url for a json.<br><br>
      <b>response = fetch(url);</b><br>
      <b>data = response.json();</b><br>
      <i>We use fetch and the response object to get the body text of the json, which in turn is changed into a proper JSON  by parsing that body into a JSON.</i><br>
      </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Converting JSON into Javascript Objects</h4>
      <div class="snippet">
      <p>This method allows you to store information obtained from a JSON file into a javascript object.<br><br>
      <b>sample = JSON.parse(json);</b><br>
      <i>Will push values of json into the object sample.</i><br>
      </p>
      </div>
